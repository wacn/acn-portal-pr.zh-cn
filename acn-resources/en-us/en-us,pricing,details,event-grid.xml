                <p>Event Grid is a fully managed event routing service that provides reliable message delivery at massive scale. Developers use Event Grid to build reactive, event-driven apps in a modern, serverless compute architecture—eliminating polling and its associated cost and latency. One-to-many mapping, in which a single event can trigger multiple actions, provides a uniform event consumption experience. A pay-per-operation model complements and extends your serverless solutions and lets you focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.</p>

                <h2>Event Grid consumption pricing</h2>
                <p>Event Grid is priced as pay-per-use based on operations performed. Operations include ingress of events to Domains or Topics, advanced matches, delivery attempts, and management calls. Plan pricing includes a monthly free grant of 100,000 operations.</p>
