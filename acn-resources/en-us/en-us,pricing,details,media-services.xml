                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If there is a QuickTime video with a resolution of 1920x1080p and a duration of 20 minutes, then it will encode as a mono track MP4 output with the same resolution of 1920x1080p. The effective multiplier will be 2 (HD) plus 0.25 (audio) with a total multiplier of 2.25. The total billing minutes will be (20 minutes x 2.25) = 45 output minutes. If Media Encoder Standard is applied for encoding, the cost will be (45 output minutes x ￥0.09858/output minutes) = ￥4.4361</p>

                    <p>If the workload requires running multiple tasks at the same time, a Media reserved unit is recommended. The overall throughput of the service can be increased by:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Increasing the number of media reserved units to achieve parallel processing of more tasks</li>
							<li>Using faster media reserved units (e.g. S3)</li>

                                    <p>Adding media reserved units to your account ensures that multiple files can be processed simultaneously, and changing media reserved unit types can affect the speed with which files are processed. For example, if an account has 3 S1 media reserved units, up to 3 files can be processed simultaneously. Changing the reserved unit type to S3 will allow faster processing of individual files.

                                    <p>Example 2: Joe uses a standard encoder to process 30 encoding jobs. Each job will create 10 output minutes (300 output minutes in total). This time, Joe uses three S2 media reserved units (RUs). Each job will take only 1 hour to complete, so it takes only 10 hours to complete 30 jobs. Joe spends a total of 10 hours in a row on 3 S2 RU and then turns off the RU (the RU number was set to zero).</p>

                                        <li>Output minutes (standard encoder): 300 x ￥0.09858 /minute = ￥29.574</li>
                                        <li>S2 media reserved unit: 3 unit x 10 hours x ￥0.26288 /hour = ￥7.8864</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Example 3: Joe has a two-hour movie with resolution of 1920x1080. He uses a standard encoder to encode it with a default “H264 multiple bit rate 1080p” preset to stream movies to iOS and Android devices. The encoding preset generates 3 HD output videos, 5 SD output videos, and 1 audio. The total minutes for this encoding job is (3x2 + 5 + 0.25) = 11.25. Therefore, the total output minutes will be 11.25 x 2 x 60 = 1,350. The total cost is 1,350 x ￥0.09858/min = ￥133.083.</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>You will be charged according to the actual minutes of the media reserved unit. The following is a more detailed example. Suppose Joe starts with zero media reserved units (RUs), and his account is set to use two S1 RUs at 10:00AM that day. In the afternoon other videos arrived, he changes his account to use 4 S3 RUs at 1:15PM. All videos are processed before 4:00PM, then he closes the RU in the account (setting the RU number to zero). Joe's usage is as follows.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>S1 media reserved unit: 2 units x 3.25 hours (10AM to 1:15PM) x ￥0.13144 /hour = ￥0.85436</li>
                                        <li>S3 media reserved unit: 4 units x 2.75 hours (1:15PM to 4PM) x ￥0.52576 /hour = ￥5.78336</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Therefore, the total cost arising out of Joe's use of the media reserved unit is ￥0.85436 + ￥5.78336 = ￥6.63772</p>
                                    <p>Unlike the media reserved unit, the charge for the streaming unit is based on the maximum number of streaming units configured per day (high watermarks).</p>

                                    <p>No, the charge for the media reserved unit is based on the number of minutes, while that for the streaming unit is on a daily basis.</p>
