            <li>Azure SQL Database Business Critical or Premium tiers not configured for Zone Redundant Deployments, General Purpose, Standard, or Basic tiers, or Hyperscale tier with two or more replicas have an availability guarantee of at least 99.99%.</li>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Service Level Agreement for Azure (this “SLA”) is made by 21Vianet in connection with, and is a part of, the agreement under which Customer has purchased Azure Services from 21Vianet (the “Agreement”).</p>
        <p>We provide financial backing to our commitment to achieve and maintain Service Levels for our Services. If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. These terms will be fixed for term of your Agreement. If a subscription is renewed, the version of this SLA that is current at the time the renewal term commences will apply throughout the renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days' notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting <a href="/support/legal/sla/">https://www.azure.cn/support/legal/sla/</a>.</p>

        <h2>The SLA details</h2>
        <h3>Additional Definitions</h3>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Availability Zone</strong>&quot; is a fault-isolated area within an Azure region, providing redundant power, cooling, and networking.</p>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Database</strong>&quot; means any Azure SQL Database created in any of the Service tiers and deployed either as a single database or in an Elastic Pool or Managed Instance.</p>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Zone Redundant Deployment</strong>&quot; is a Database that includes multiple synchronized replicas provisioned in different Availability Zones.</p>
        <h3>Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for Azure SQL Database Service</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Deployment Minutes</strong>&quot; is the total number of minutes that a given Database has been operational in Azure during a billing month. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Maximum Available Minutes</strong>&quot; is the sum of all Deployment Minutes for a given Microsoft Azure subscription during a billing month. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Downtime</strong>&quot; is the total accumulated Deployment Minutes across all Databases in a given Azure subscription during which the Database is unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable for a given Database if all continuous attempts by Customer to establish a connection to the Database within the minute fail.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Monthly Uptime Percentage</strong>&quot; for a given Database is calculated as Maximum Available Minutes less Downtime divided by Maximum Available Minutes in a billing month for a given Azure subscription. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:</p>
        <p>Monthly Uptime % = 100 * (Maximum Available Minutes-Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes</p>
