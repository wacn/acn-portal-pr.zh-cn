                    <li>Supports syncing data from an enterprise’s local MySQL Database to MySQL Database on Azure, so you can better meet the requirements for businesses building hybrid clouds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Premium (MP1 - MP2):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greatly increased IO performance based on Azure Premium Storage.</li>
                    <li>The maximum number of connections to an individual database instance is as high as 6,000.</li>

                    <li>System snapshot backup retention times are increased from 7 days to 35 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Supports flexible upscaling/downscaling and simplifies the purchase experience</h2>
                <p>You no longer need to keep recalculating your database server configuration requirements, or worry about how to adjust various aspects of the configuration to achieve better database performance. The MySQL Database on Azure service is available in several different performance versions, so you can choose the version that matches your current performance requirements and then flexibly upscale or downscale as actual operating conditions change. Our services are charged by the hour with transparent billing that helps you to make efficient use of resources.</p>

                <h2>Excellent database reliability and security</h2>
                <p>Based on Azure’s geographic redundancy storage, MySQL Database on Azure provides high levels of data reliability, with automatic synchronous replication of 3 local copies in the same region, as well as asynchronous replication of 3 remote copies in regions over a thousand kilometers away, to ensure data reliability. In terms of data access security, the service provides firewall functions and also supports database access via SSL connections.</p>

                <h2>Provides high availability, supports disaster recovery, and guarantees service continuity</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure provides a 99.9% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA) that guarantees high service availability and continuity for user services. Geographic redundancy-based data storage also provides support for remote disaster recovery, giving users appropriate protection in even the most extreme situations.</p>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure supports enabling readable standby databases, helping users to further increase the availability of MySQL instances. Once the user has enabled the readable standby instance function, Azure will automatically create a standby instance and data will be synced between the master and standby instances using replication technology. You can use the standby database for read-only use to meet high read demand from apps. If the master instance fails, Azure will automatically upgrade the standby instance to a master instance and create a new standby instance. Once you have enabled the readable standby instance function, recovery times are generally less than 60 seconds and there will be no data loss after a failover.</p>

                <h2>Backups up to 35 days with easy data recall</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure backs up your database (snapshot) every day at the time that you specify and backups are retained for as long as 35 days (30 days for the basic version). MySQL Database on Azure also supports incremental backups for the last 35 days (7 days for the basic version), and you can also create 10 instant snapshot backups. Backups do not count against the data storage quota allocated for the database. You can easily go back to any time point in the last 35 days (7 days for the basic version) or restore a specific snapshot stored within the system.</p>

                <h2>Rapid deployment with no need for manual infrastructure maintenance</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure makes it easy to deploy a MySQL Database server that has high availability in just one or two minutes. It also provides an automatic software patch function, which means that you don’t need to perform any infrastructure maintenance on the database service.</p>

                <h2>Provides an excellent monitoring experience</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure supports real-time monitoring of a variety of database metrics and historical data, helping you to better understand database usage, identify problems, and make adjustments in a timely manner. It also supports enabling database log downloads, so that database administrators can better manage and optimize databases.</p>

                <h2>Supports familiar platforms and tools</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure is compatible with MySQL protocols and supports MySQL versions 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7. You can use common platforms with MySQL support for development and integration, and you can also use familiar management tools such as Workbench and Navicat.</p>
                
                <h2>Supports remote database synchronization to meet enterprise needs for hybrid cloud construction</h2>
                <p>MySQL Database on Azure supports remote database synchronization. For example, you can set a MySQL instance outside Azure as the master database and another instance running on Azure as the subordinate database. You can then use standard MySQL master or subordinate data-synchronization methods to sync the data to Azure. This method enables MySQL Database on Azure to meet the needs of a range of hybrid cloud scenarios for business. The database synchronization functions also help you to implement a more comprehensive and flexible cloud migration experience.</p>

                                    <section>
                                        <p>No. Your monthly total bill once on Azure Database for MySQL will be the same as your total monthly bill on MySQL Database on Azure. For example: if you are an MS4 customer currently paying ¥1,071.36 per month for MySQL Database on Azure, you will continue to pay ¥1,071.36 per month once on Azure Database for MySQL.</p>

                                    <a id="pricing_mysql_question5">Will my bill look different after I migrate from MySQL Database on Azure to Azure Database for MySQL? How will my bill look different?</a>
                                    <section>
                                        <p>Yes, your bill will look different after we migrated you from MySQL Database on Azure to Azure Database for MySQL, but your total bill amount will remain the same. Today with MySQL Database on Azure you are charged for the version   you are using (MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5, MS6, MP1, or MP2), which includes a free amount of storage called “free database capacity”. If you use more storage than is included in this free database capacity, then you are billed ¥0.6116 per GB per month for that excess storage.</p>
                                        <p>After the migration to Azure Database for MySQL, you will be charged for the compute and storage resources you provision. Compute resources are charged per vCore per hour. Storage is charged  per provisioned GB per month. Azure Database for MySQL does not include “free database capacity”. </p>
                                        <p>Let us look at an example that describes how you will be billed before and after you migrate to Azure Database for MySQL: </p>
                                        <p>Let us assume you are using MS5 with 200 GB of storage. MS5 includes 100 GB of “free database capacity”. That makes the bill look like this:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>MS5 server:  ¥2.1613 per hour x 744 hours per month = ¥1,608.01 per month</li>
                                            <li>Storage Overage: ¥0.6116 per GB per month x (200 GB used – 100 GB free) = ¥61.16 per month</li>
                                            <li>Total Bill: ¥1,608.01 per month + ¥61.16 per month = $1,669.17 per month</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>During the migration to Azure Database for MySQL the MS5 server will migrate to General Purpose 4 vCore with 200 GB provisioned storage.  The pricing look as follows:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Compute: ¥0.5198 per vCore per hour x 4 vCore x 744 hours per month = ¥1,546.85 per month</li>
                                            <li>Storage: ¥0.6116 per GB per Month x 200 GB = ¥122.32 per month</li>
                                            <li>Total Bill: ¥1,546.85 per month + ¥122.32 per month = $1,669.17 per month</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>So in this example, the total monthly bill for MySQL Database on Azure MS5 and the equivalent offer on Azure Database for MySQL is the same.</p>

                                 <section>
                                        <p>MySQL Database on Azure includes a free amount of storage called “free database capacity”. This free database capacity varies by version (MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, MS5, MS6, MP1, or MP2).</p>
                                        <p>Azure Database for MySQL does not include free storage. Instead Azure Database for MySQL charges for compute in vCores per hour and provisioned storage  in GB per month separately. Each MySQL Database on Azure migrated to Azure Database for MySQL will be provisioned with a minimum storage size equivalent to the free database capacity for MySQL Database on Azure. For example, if you are an MS1 customer, your database will be provisioned with a minimum of 100 GB of storage.</p>
                                        <p>To maintain the same total monthly bill for customers who have migrated from MySQL Database on Azure to Azure Database for MySQL, migrated customers will be billed using a special “legacy” compute and storage meters that maintain your total monthly bill. These “legacy” meters are priced to offset the loss of the “free database capacity” included in MySQL Database on Azure.</p>

                                        <p>The impact to your server and workload will be minimal. We migrate server from MySQL Database for Azure to the new Azure Database for MySQL using replication. This means that the server will be online during the migration except for the final phase of the migration that includes the failover to the new server. The connection string to the server will remain the same, so that you do not have to change your application logic. </p>
                                        <p>Below are the migration steps in short:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>We take a snapshot of the server in MySQL Database for Azure.</li>
                                            <li>We restore that snapshot in a new Azure Database for MySQL server.</li>
                                            <li>Set up replication between the old and the new server to catch up all changes since the snapshot.</li>
                                            <li>When the new server is caught up except for in-flight transactions, we set the old server to read-only mode for new transactions.</li>
                                            <li>The new server catches up with the latest changes and we stop the replication.</li>
                                            <li>We then copy configurations, firewall rules and redirect DNS from the old to the new server and finally stop the old server. </li>
                                            <li>All new connections to against the new server. No changes to your application are required.</li>
                                        </ol>
