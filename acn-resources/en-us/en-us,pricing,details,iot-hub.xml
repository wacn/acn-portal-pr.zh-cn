                    <!-- <p>Azure IoT Hub has four editions: the Free Edition, S1 Edition, S2 Edition, and S3 Edition. IoT Hub has now been publically released and the new pricing will take effect as indicated below.</p>
                    <p><strong>Free Edition:</strong> Free trial of Azure IoT Hub services. Upon sign up, you can transmit up to 8,000 messages per day. It is suitable for understanding and testing features of IoT Hub services.</p>
                    <p><strong>S1 Edition:</strong> The IoT Hub S1 edition is designed for IoT solutions that generate relatively small amounts of data. Each S1 Edition pricing unit allows you to transfer up to 400,000 million messages per day across all connected devices.</p>
                    <p><strong>S2 Edition:</strong> The IoT Hub S2 Edition is designed for IoT solutions that generate relatively large amounts of data. Each S2 Edition pricing unit allows you to transfer up to 6 million messages per day across all connected devices.</p>
                    <p><strong>S3 Edition:</strong> The IoT Hub S3 Edition is designed for IoT solutions that generate extra large amounts of data. Each S3 Edition pricing unit allows you to transfer up to 300 million messages per day across all connected devices.</p> -->
                    <p>Connect your IoT devices and build your IoT solution to turn data into business intelligence.</p>

                                    <p>Every tier has daily message limit after which you will experience throttling. Please check throttling documentation for more details. If your need change, you can adjust the units within IoT Hub. You can also change the unit type within a tier (e.g.: from S1 to S2) or upgrade to a higher tier (e.g.: B1 to S2). If you anticipate using more than 200 units of the IoT Hub S1 S2 SKU’s and IoT Hub B1 B2 SKU’s or more than 10 units of the IoT Hub B3 or S3 please contact Microsoft Support.</p>

                                    <p>The maximum message size for messages sent from a device to the cloud is 256 KB. These messages are metered in 4 KB blocks for the paid tiers so for instance if the device sends a 16 KB message via the paid tiers it will be billed as 4 messages. The messages sent by devices connected via the free edition are metered in 0.5 KB blocks. For instance, if the device sends a 16 KB message via the IoT Hub free tier it will be billed as 32 messages.</p>
                                    <p>The maximum message size for message sent from the cloud to a device is 64 KB and is metered in 4-KB blocks for the paid tiers so, for instance, an 8-KB message sent via paid tiers would be billed as two messages. The messages sent using the free edition are metered in 0.5-KB blocks. For instance, an 8-KB message sent via the IoT Hub free tier will be billed as 16 messages.</p>

                                    <p>Only the messages which initiate a new upload and provide notification of a completed upload count against the daily allotment of messages. Customers must provide their own storage account and pay for storage. There is no separate charge for file upload. For example, in a typical file upload scenario, there are only two messages—the message that indicates that a file upload has been initiated, and the message that indicates that a file upload has been completed. Customers can choose to send additional data in the status description during notifications of a failed upload. Refer to the IoT Hub documentation for additional details about the file upload feature.</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>Device twins contain device state information (metadata, configurations, and conditions) and are stored as JSON documents. Twins can be modified by your cloud and device applications, and support a rich query language. Device twins are the fundamental primitive of IoT Hub Device Management and can be accessed through several operations such as read, write, and queries. In addition, a device twin is shared between different device management components, basically with no isolation between components. With the introduction of module identity and module twin, an IoT developer can work separately without having others access his or her twin content. Each component on the device can work in isolation.</p>

For instance, reading a 4-KB twin is billed as eight messages, updating a twin with a 1-KB payload is billed as two messages, querying twins for a 10-KB result is billed as 20 messages. All other messages are charged in chunks of 4-KB for the paid tiers (S1, S2, S3), and 0.5 KB for the free tier.</p>

The cloud receives an immediate response from the device. Both requests and responses can be at most 8 KB and are metered in 4-KB blocks for the paid tiers (i.e. S1, S2, and S3) so, for instance, an 8 KB request sent via the S1, S2, or S3 tiers would be billed as two messages. The requests sent using the free tier are metered in 0.5-KB blocks. For instance, an 8-KB message sent via the IoT Hub free tier will be billed as 16 messages.</p>

                                    <p>You can choose to increase the number of IoT Hub units purchased at any time. If you sign up for the service mid-month, your monthly bill will be pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the month. (For the purpose of the IoT Hub service, a month is defined as 31 days). If you increase the number of units of IoT Hub mid-month, your monthly bill will be based on the number of units available for each day during the month.</p>

                                    <p>IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service is billed by the number of operations. Operations include device registrations and re-registrations; operations also include service-side changes such as adding enrollment list entries, updating enrollment list entries and get/query operations. Every six months of inactivity on a given enrollment entry will incur a "keep-alive" operation.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, you have to take the action of explicitly switching from one paid edition to another. The device identity and all messages are carried over to the new edition. If a customer wants to move from a higher tier to a lower tier, for instance from S2 to S1, and they have consumed more messages than S1 allows per day, then for that day the customer is billed at S2, and the customer is billed at the S1 rate starting the next day.</p>
