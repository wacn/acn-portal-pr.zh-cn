            	<h2>Now available: General Purpose v2 storage account</h2>
            	<p>Azure now offers three types of storage accounts: General Purpose v2, General Purpose v1, and Blob Storage. Storage accounts determine eligibility for certain storage services and features, and each is priced differently. We recommend thoroughly reviewing the pricing models to determine which is the most appropriate, as some workloads can be priced very differently depending on which account type is used.</p>
            	<p>For new customers, we generally recommend General Purpose v2 for access to the latest storage features, including Tiered Storage and Archive. We recommend General Purpose v1 and Blob Storage accounts only for customers with prior experience with those accounts, but these customers may also benefit from using GPv2. Learn more about the<a href="//docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/storage/common/storage-account-options/">benefits of different storage account types</a>.</p>

			                    <section>
			                        <p>Yes. Storage capacity is billed in units of the average daily amount of data stored, in gigabytes (GB), over a monthly period. For example, if you consistently used 10 GB of storage for the first half of the month, and none for the second half of the month, you would be billed for your average usage of 5 GB of storage. However, using the Cool (GPv2 accounts only) or Archive tier for less than 30 and 180 days respectively will incur an additional charge.</p>
