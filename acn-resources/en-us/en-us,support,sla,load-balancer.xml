        <div class="tags-date">
        <p><b>The SLA of Load Balancer below will be effective from 1/1/2019</b></p>
        <div class="ms-date">Updated: 11/2018</div></div>
        <p>We guarantee that a Load Balanced Endpoint using Azure Standard Load Balancer, serving two or more Healthy Virtual Machine Instances, will be available 99.99% of the time. </p>
        <p>Basic Load Balancer is excluded from this SLA.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Service Level Agreement for Azure (this “SLA”) is made by 21Vianet in connection with, and is a part of, the agreement under which Customer has purchased Azure Services from 21Vianet (the “Agreement”).</p>
        <p>We provide financial backing to our commitment to achieve and maintain Service Levels for our Services. If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each Service as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of your monthly service fees. These terms will be fixed for term of your Agreement. If a subscription is renewed, the version of this SLA that is current at the time the renewal term commences will apply throughout the renewal term. We will provide at least 90 days' notice for adverse material changes to this SLA. You can review the most current version of this SLA at any time by visiting <a href="/support/legal/sla/">https://www.azure.cn/support/legal/sla/</a>.</p>

        <h2>The SLA details</h2>
        <h3>Additional Definitions</h3>
        <p>"Load Balanced Endpoint" is an IP address and associated IP transport port definition.</p>
        <p>"Healthy Virtual Machine" is a Virtual Machine which returns a Success Code for the health probe sent by the Azure Standard Load Balancer. The Virtual Machine must have Network Security Group rules permitting communication with the load balanced port.</p>
        <p>"Connectivity" is bi-directional network traffic over supported IP transport protocols that can be sent and received from any IP address configured to allow traffic.</p>

        <h3>Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for Azure Load Balancer</h3>
        <p><b>"Maximum Available Minutes"</b> is the total number of minutes that a given Azure Standard Load Balancer (serving two or more Healthy Virtual Machines) has been deployed by Customer in a Microsoft Azure subscription during a billing month.</p>
        <p><b>"Downtime"</b> is the total number of minutes within Maximum Available Minutes during which the given Azure Standard Load Balancer is unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable if all Healthy Virtual Machines have no Connectivity through the Load Balanced Endpoint. Downtime does not include minutes resulting from SNAT port exhaustions.</p>
        <p><b>"Monthly Uptime Percentage"</b>for Azure Standard Load Balancer is calculated as Maximum Available Minutes less Downtime divided by Maximum Available Minutes multiplied by 100.</p>
        <p>Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:</p>
        <p>Monthly Uptime % = (Maximum Available Minutes – Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes X 100</p>
        <p>The following Service Levels and Service Credit are applicable to Customer’s use of the Azure Load Balancer</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>MONTHLY UPTIME PERCENTAGE</th>
            <th>SERVICE CREDIT</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;99.99%</td>
            <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;99.9%</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
